# 3. Component Model

This section defines component model.

Components describe functional units that may be instantiated as part of a larger distributed application. For example, each microservice in an application is described as a component. The description itself is not an instance of that microservice, but a declaration of the operational capabilities of that microservice. The application describes how components are grouped together and how instances of those components are then configured.

Component owners are responsible for describing available application components by authoring `WorkloadDefinition` in the platform.

> Hence, the _WorkloadDefinition_ replaces _ComponentSchematic_ in v1alpha1 specification).

## Representation

The role of a workload definition is to permit component owners to declare, in infrastructure-neutral format, the runtime characteristics of a discrete unit of execution.

For example, a web service may be modeled as a component type.

### Top-Level Attributes

Here are the attributes that provide top-level information about the workload definition.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y | | A string that identifies the version of the schema the object should have. The core types uses `core.oam.dev/v1alpha2` in this version of specification |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || Must be `WorkloadDefinition` |
| `metadata` | [`Metadata`](2.overview_and_terminology.md#metadata) | Y | | Component metadata. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y | | A container for the workload definition. |

#### Spec

The specification section contains a reference to the workload definition.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `definitionRef` | [`DefinitionRef`](#definitionref) | Y | | Identifier to workload type of this component. |
| `extension` | unstructured | N | | <kbd>EXPERIMENTAL</kbd> An unstructured field to carry schematic information for this component such as **template** and **configurable parameters**. The implementation should NOT abuse this field for other purposes. |

##### DefinitionRef

`DefinitionRef` identifies the workload type of this component.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | `string` | N | | Name identifier of the workload type. Mutually exclusive to `apiVersion` and `kind`.|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | N | | API version of the workload type. |
| `kind` | `string` | N || Kind of the workload type. |

It's RECOMMENDED to use [Group/Version/Kind](2.overview_and_terminology.md#group) to uniquely identify the workload type. If using `definitionRef.name`, it MUST contain information that can be used to uniquely identify it. 

### Example

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: worker # component type
  annotations:
    definition.oam.dev/description: "Long-running scalable backend worker without network endpoint"
spec:
  definitionRef: # workload identifier
    name: deployments.apps
  extension:
    template: |
      output: {
        apiVersion: "apps/v1"
        kind:       "Deployment"
        spec: {
          selector: matchLabels: {
            "app.oam.dev/component": context.name
          }
          template: {
            metadata: labels: {
              "app.oam.dev/component": context.name
            }
            spec: {
              containers: [{
                name:  context.name
                image: parameter.image
                if parameter["cmd"] != _|_ {
                  command: parameter.cmd
                }
              }]
            }
          }
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              "app.oam.dev/component": context.name
        }
      }
      parameter: {
        // +usage=Which image would you like to use for your service
        // +short=i
        image: string
        cmd?: [...string]
      }
```

This `WorkloadDefinition` uses [CUE](https://github.com/cuelang/cue) as templating module. It defines a Kubernetes Deployment workload template, and exposes two configurable parameters (i.e. `image` and `cmd`) to end users. Note that OAM doesn't have opinion on the specific tool for templating module.

With above `WorkloadDefinition` installed in the runtime, the end user of the platform would be able to declare a component in an application as below:

```yaml
# full application definition
...
components:
  - name: my-worker-component # name of the component instance
    type: worker # name of the WorkloadDefinition
    settings: # parameters exposed by the WorkloadDefinition
      image: "busybox"
      cmd:
        - sleep
        - "1000"
```

Once applied, the OAM Kubernetes runtime should generate a corresponding Kubernetes Deployment resource with given workload settings.
