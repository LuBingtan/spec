# 3. The Component Model

This section defines component model.

Components describe functional units that may be instantiated as part of a larger distributed application. For example, each microservice in an application is described as a component. The description itself is not an instance of that microservice, but a declaration of the operational capabilities of that microservice. The application describes how components are grouped together and how instances of those components are then configured.

The detailed specification of component will be illustrated in [Application](7.application_configuration.md) section.
