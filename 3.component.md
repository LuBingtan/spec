# 3. Components

This section defines components.

Components describe functional units that may be instantiated as part of a larger distributed application. For example, each microservice in an application is described as a component. The description itself is not an instance of that microservice, but a declaration of the operational capabilities of that microservice. The application describes how components are grouped together and how instances of those components are then configured.

The component is by design a part of the full application description, thus its detailed specification will be illustrated in [Application](7.application_configuration.md) section.

> Note that component described in this section is NOT `ComponentSchematic` in v1alpha1 spec. The later has been replaced by `WorkloadDefinition` in v0.2.x spec release.
