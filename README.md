Open Application Model (OAM) is a runtime-agnostic specification for defining cloud native applications and enable building application-centric platforms by natural.

Focused on **application** rather than container or orchestrator, _Open Application Model_ brings modular, extensible, and portable design for modeling cloud native applications and enable building application-centric platforms on any runtime infrastructure like Kubernetes, cloud, or IoT devices.

### Why Open Application Model?

Platforms without application context are hard:

- Developers spend time on infrastructure details instead of applications - ingress, labels, iptables rules, DNS, etc, and learning how the platform is implemented.
- Restricted platform capabilities - in-house APIs with opinionated abstractions and implementations, lack of interoperability.
- Runtime lock-in - platform is tightly coupled with execution runtime, which heavily impact on how you configure, develop and operate your application.

In Open Application Model, we propose an app-centric approach instead:

- Application first - build the platform around a self-contained app model, where operational features as part of app definition, free of infrastructure here.
- Clarity and extensibility - an open standard to modularize your platform capabilities into reusable pieces, with freedom to bring your own abstractions and implementations.
- Runtime agnostic - a consistent experience to deploy and operate your apps across on-prem clusters, cloud providers or even edge devices.

> **NOTICE:** The current working draft of OAM specification (0.2.x release) is under pre-beta release, it's still under development but will keep backward compatibility for any further change.

## Introduction

_"Developers think in terms of application architecture, not of infrastructure."_

Open Application Model defines a series of standard but extensible abstractions to model micro-service applications, with operation features as part of the application definition. This enables platform builders to create runtime-agnostic systems around a unified model, by developing modularized components and traits, and essentially serve their customers (e.g. developers) with app-centric mindset by default.

### Separation of Concerns

Open Application Model proposed a clear separation of concerns between the parts that developers are responsible for, and the parts that platform engineers are responsible for. For more details, see [introduction.md](./introduction.md).
