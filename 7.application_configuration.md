# 7. Application

This section describes how applications are designed and deployed.

> The _Application_ was known as _ApplicationConfiguration_ in prior releases).

## Defining an application

### Top-Level Attributes

The top-level attributes of a application define its metadata, version, kind, and spec.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y || A string that identifies the version of the schema the object should have. The core types uses `core.oam.dev/v1alpha2` in this version of specification. |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || Must be `Application` |
| `metadata` | [`Metadata`](2.overview_and_terminology.md#metadata) | Y | | Information about the application. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y || A specification for application attributes. |

### Spec

The specification defines component instances to create, traits attached to it, and a set of scopes.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `components` | [`[]Component`](#component) | Y | | Component instance definitions. |

#### Component

This section defines the instances of components to create with the application.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Y | | The name of the component. |
| `type` | string | Y | | The type of workload. |
| `settings` | [`WorkloadSettings`](#workloadsettings) | Y | | The workload-specific configuration. |
| `traits` | [`[]Trait`](#trait) | N | | The traits to attach to this component instance. |
| `scopes` | [`[]Scope`](#scope) | N | | The scopes to be used in the component. A component joins a scope by referencing it. |

In addition to being unique, the `name` must follow these naming rules:

> The name field is required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between.

##### Type

In practice, the available workload types are registered by infrastructure operators/platform builders to the platform following OAM specification. They are explained in detail in this chapter: [workload definition](4.workload_types.md).

##### WorkloadSettings

This section is the location for specifying workload-specific configuration whose structure is determined by the [definition reference](4.workload_types.md#definitionref) of corresponding `WorkloadDefinition`. 

The implementation will use `WorkloadSettings` as the **template** to generate the instances of given workload type. For example, in Kubernetes implementation, a `Server` component would generate multiple immutable revisions of Deployment such as `frontend-v1` and `frontend-v2` upon every modification based on its `WorkloadSettings`.

#### Scope

The scope section defines the scope into which the component should be deployed.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `scopeRef` | [`ScopeRef`](#scoperef) | Y | | The reference information of the Scope. |

##### ScopeRef

The scopeRef section will index a scope instance by `apiVersion`, `kind` and `name`.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y | | The apiVersion of the Scope. |
| `kind` | `string` | Y | | The kind of the Scope. |
| `name` | `string` | Y | | The name of the Scope. |

> The name field is required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between.

#### Trait

The trait section defines an instance of a trait.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name`| string | N | |  The name of trait definition. This is used to reference to the definition/schema of the Trait. For one type of trait, there could be only one config/deploy in one component. |
| `properties`| [`Properties`](#properties) | N | |  The configurable properties that are exposed by this trait. |

> The `name` field must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between.


##### Properties

A properties object for trait is an object whose structure is determined by the [definition reference](6.traits.md#DefinitionRef) of corresponding `TraitDefinition`. It may be a simple value, or it may be a complex object. Properties are validated against the schema appropriate for the trait.

## Example

The following is an example of a complete YAML file that expresses components and traits. This example illustrates the four configurational elements of a component: its name, workload settings, traits, and scopes.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: my-app-deployment
  annotations:
    version: v1.0.0
    description: "Description of this deployment"
spec:
  components:
    - name: my-web-app-component
      type: Server
      settings:
        containers:
        - name: my-cool-workload
          image: example/very-cool-workload:0.1.2@sha256:verytrustworthyhash
          resources:
            cpu:
              required: 1.0
            memory:
              required: 100MB
          cmd:
          - "bash lscpu"
          ports:
          - name: http
            value: 8080
      traits:
        - name: scaler
          properties:
            replicas: 2
      scopes:
        - scopeRef:
            apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2
            kind: NetworkScope
            name: example-vpc-network
```

The example above illustrates a complete application, including its scopes, components and their traits. This application assumes a [WorkloadDefinition](4.workload_types.md) named `Server` and a [TraitDefinition](6.traits.md) named `scaler` are present in the runtime cluster. The templates defined in them will enforce the schema of this application.

## Workload instances and revisions of component

A _workload instance_ is an instance of a component that is created during the deployment of an application. It is created when a component is deployed together with a configuration.

- Each time a component is deployed, it must be deployed _with a configuration_. This section of the specification describes configurations.
- Each subsequent _upgrade_ of a component will modify the given instance, or generate a new revision of instance if any revision-aware traits are attached to the component. 
- When an instance is first created, it is in its _initial revision state_. Each time an upgrade operation occurs, we say that a new _revision_ of that instance occurs. (There is, however, no assumption that there must be a corresponding `revision` object stored somewhere).

> For the purposes of this specification, workflow practices such as _rollback_ or _redeploy_  are considered to be special cases of _upgrade_ (that is, if the rules here apply to upgrade, they also apply to the other workflow practices). When a deployment of a component is _deleted_, the instance is considered to be deleted. This does not, however, imply that all data related to the instance must be deleted, or that deletion events cannot be recovered or undone.

An _application_ (sometimes abbreviated to _configuration_) is managed by the _application operator_ role, and provides information specific to the current instance of a component. The following information is considered specific to the runtime instance of a component:

- Information about the particular instance, such as:
    - Name
    - Revision
    - Description
- Workload setting values for the defined `parameters` for the workload type
- Non revision-aware trait assignments, together with any trait configuration
  - For revision-aware trait, it doesn't bind with specific revision of the instance because it may control multiple revisions at the same time.

### Releases

In [*Twelve-Factor Applications*](https://12factor.net/), a release is defined as a [build plus a set of configs](https://12factor.net/build-release-run). That is, any change to either a build or configuration produces a new release. In the Open Application Model, the analog is that component, trait, and scope objects combined with an application jointly constitute a release.

For OAM applications, a release is defined thus:

> A release is a named application, together with its description of correlated components, scopes, and traits.

In addition, as an application is released, its _workload instances_ (running copies of a named component) are also released.

To accommodate this definition of a release, an OAM platform SHOULD make the following assumptions:

- An application is mutable.
- Any change to an [application](7.application_configuration.md) results (conceptually) in a new release that supersedes older releases.
  * If an application is updated, and the new version includes components not present in the original application, component instances MUST be created
  * If an application is updated, and the new version does not have a record of a component that the previous application contained, that component instance MUST be deleted
  * Traits similarly SHOULD be attached and detached according to the same guidelines
  * Components' relationships to Application Scopes SHOULD be applied or removed according to the same guidelines

The releases can also be named as `Snapshot` according to the implementations, it's not enforced by the specification for now.
