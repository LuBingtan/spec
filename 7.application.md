# 7. Application

This section describes how applications are designed and deployed. An application represents the top-level entity in OAM, and defines which components will be instanciated once the application is deployed. In the _Application_ entity it is possible to specify the final parametrization of each component and the traits that are applied to augment their funcionality or alter their behavior. Additionally, a set of scopes grouping different subsets of components can be specified.

> Up to v0.3.0 of the current specification, the _Application_ was known as _ApplicationConfiguration_.

## Defining an application

### Top-Level Attributes

The top-level attributes of a application define its metadata, version, kind, and spec.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `apiVersion` | `string` | Y || A string that identifies the version of the schema the object should have. The core types uses `core.oam.dev/v1beta1` in this version of specification. |
| `kind` | `string` | Y || Must be `Application` |
| `metadata` | [`Metadata`](metadata.md) | Y | | Information about the application. |
| `spec`| [`Spec`](#spec) | Y || A specification for application attributes. |

### Spec

The specification defines component instances to create, traits attached to it, and a set of scopes.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `components` | [`[]Component`](#component) | Y | | Component instance definitions. |

#### Component

This section defines the instances of components to create with the application.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Y | | The name of the component. This name may be used by the OAM runtime to name or associated generated entities. |
| `type` | string | Y | | A reference to the [Component](3.component.md) that will be instanciated by the application. Optionally a namespaced component may be referenced as `<namespace>/<component_name>`. The meaning of _namespace_ is implementation specific depending on the runtime being used and the target platform where entities are created. In the case of the Kubernetes OAM runtime, the concept of `namespace` matches the existing one in Kubernetes. |
| `properties` | [`Properties`](#properties) | N | | A set of values assigned to the parameters exposed from the [component definition](3.component.md). |
| `traits` | [`[]Trait`](#trait) | N | | The traits to attach to this component instance. |
| `scopes` | `map[string]string` | N | | A map with the scopes the component belongs to. The map uses the qualified scope definition name as key (e.g., "scope.company.com"), and the name of the scope as value (e.g., "myscope"). Notice that this reference implies that an entity of the target scope with the specific name exists.|

The `name` must follow these naming rules:

> The name field is required and must be 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character ([a-z0-9A-Z]) with dashes (-), underscores (_), dots (.), and alphanumerics between.

##### WorkloadSettings

This section is the location for specifying workload-specific configuration whose structure is determined by the [definition reference](4.workload_types.md#definitionref) of corresponding `WorkloadDefinition`. 

The implementation will use `WorkloadSettings` as the **template** to generate the instances of given workload type. For example, in Kubernetes implementation, a `Server` component would generate multiple immutable revisions of Deployment such as `frontend-v1` and `frontend-v2` upon every modification based on its `WorkloadSettings`.


#### Trait

The trait section defines an instance of a trait.

| Attribute | Type | Required | Default Value | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------------|-------------|
| `type`| string | N | |  The name of trait definition. This is used to reference to the definition/schema of the Trait. For one type of trait, there could be only one config/deploy in one component. |
| `properties`| [`Properties`](#properties) | N | |  The configurable properties that are exposed by this trait. |

Notice that _Traits_ do not require a name since it is the OAM runtime the one responsible of instanciating the traits. The name of the component is expected to be used for the associated traits.


##### Properties

Properties specify the values that are associated with the entity attributes. When associated with _Components_ the values set or overwrite the component available parameters. Component parametrization is discussed on the [Component](3.component.md) entity spec. 

Similarly, when properties are used on _Traits_ or _Scopes_ they set the values required by those entities to be instanciated. The structure is determined by the [definition reference](6.traits.md#DefinitionRef) of corresponding `TraitDefinition`. It may be a simple value, or it may be a complex object. Properties are validated against the schema appropriate for the trait or scope.

## Example

The following is an example of a complete YAML file that expresses components, traits, and scopes. This example illustrates the four configurational elements of a component: its type, properties, traits, and scopes.

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1beta1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: my-example-app
  annotations:
    version: v1.0.0
    description: "Brief description of the application"
spec:
  components:
    - name: publicweb
      type: web-ui
      properties: # properties targeting component parameters.
        image: example/web-ui:v1.0.2@sha256:verytrustworthyhash
        param_1: "enabled" # param_1 is defined on the web-ui component
      traits:
        - type: ingress # ingress trait providing a public endpoint for the publicweb component of the application.
          properties: # properties are defined by the trait CRD spec. This example assumes path and port.
            path: /
            port: 8080
      scopes:
        "healthscopes.core.oam.dev": "app-health" # An application level health scope including both components.
    - name: backend
      type: company/test-backend # test-backend is referenced from other namespace
      properties:
        debug: "true" # debug is a parameter defined in the test-backend component.
      traits:
        - type: scaler # scaler trait to specify the number of replicas for the backend component
          properties:
            replicas: 4
      scopes:
        "healthscopes.core.oam.dev": "app-health" # An application level health scope including both components.
```

The example above illustrates a complete application, including its scopes, components and their traits. This application assumes the existence of two [Components](3.component.md) representing the web user interface and the backend of an imaginary application. Two [Trait](6.traits.md) are used to augment the functionality of the components. First an scaler on the backend to set the replication factor, and an Ingress one to expose the application to the outside world. Additionally, a HealthScope is used to have a common point to check the status of both the web and backend components. This is an arbitrary set of components for the purpose of the example and not necessarilly requires all of them.

Upon instanciation of the application, the runtime is expected to generated the required entities depending on the target system (e.g., Kubernetes) enforcing the schemas associated with each entity (e.g., a trait). As _Traits_ can be added to existing environments as extensions, the OAM runtime must be able to create any Trait entity that is registered on the system by means of a [TraitDefinition](6.traits.md##trait_definition).

## Component instances and revisions of component instances

A _component instance_ is created during the deployment of an application. It is created when a component is deployed together with a configuration.

- Each time a component is deployed, it must be deployed _with a configuration_. This section of the specification describes configurations.
- Each subsequent _upgrade_ of a component will modify the given instance, or generate a new revision of instance if any revision-aware traits are attached to the component. 
- When an instance is first created, it is in its _initial revision state_. Each time an upgrade operation occurs, we say that a new _revision_ of that instance occurs. (There is, however, no assumption that there must be a corresponding `revision` object stored somewhere).

> For the purposes of this specification, workflow practices such as _rollback_ or _redeploy_  are considered to be special cases of _upgrade_ (that is, if the rules here apply to upgrade, they also apply to the other workflow practices). When a deployment of a component is _deleted_, the instance is considered to be deleted. This does not, however, imply that all data related to the instance must be deleted, or that deletion events cannot be recovered or undone.

An _application_ is managed by the _application operator_ role, and provides information specific to the current instance of a component. The following information is considered specific to the runtime instance of a component:

- Information about the particular instance, such as:
    - Name
    - Revision
    - Description
- Workload setting values for the defined `parameters` for the workload type
- Non revision-aware trait assignments, together with any trait configuration
  - For revision-aware trait, it doesn't bind with specific revision of the instance because it may control multiple revisions at the same time.

### Releases

In [*Twelve-Factor Applications*](https://12factor.net/), a release is defined as a [build plus a set of configs](https://12factor.net/build-release-run). That is, any change to either a build or configuration produces a new release. In the Open Application Model, the analog is that component, trait, and scope objects combined with an application jointly constitute a release.

For OAM applications, a release is defined thus:

> A release is a named application, together with its description of correlated components, scopes, and traits.

In addition, as an application is released, its _workload instances_ (running copies of a named component) are also released.

To accommodate this definition of a release, an OAM platform SHOULD make the following assumptions:

- An application is mutable.
- Any change to an [application](7.application_configuration.md) results (conceptually) in a new release that supersedes older releases.
  * If an application is updated, and the new version includes components not present in the original application, component instances MUST be created
  * If an application is updated, and the new version does not have a record of a component that the previous application contained, that component instance MUST be deleted
  * Traits similarly SHOULD be attached and detached according to the same guidelines
  * Components' relationships to Application Scopes SHOULD be applied or removed according to the same guidelines

The releases can also be named as `Snapshot` according to the implementations, it's not enforced by the specification for now.
