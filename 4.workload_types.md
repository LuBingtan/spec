# 4. Workload Types

## Categories of Workload Types

There are three categories of workload types:

__Core workload types__ are the kind of workload types that every OAM runtime MUST implement according to spec definition.

__Standard workload types__ are the kind of workload types that a OAM runtime MAY implement. However, the implementation MUST strictly adhere to the schematics defined in the spec. 

__Extended workload types__ are the kind of workload types that a OAM runtime is free to define.

### Core Workload Type

A core workload type MUST be in the `core.oam.dev` group. OAM implementations MUST implement/provide all core workload types as defined in this specification.

Here is an example of a core workload type:

```yaml
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: Server
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: containerizedworkload types.core.oam.dev # this is a core workload type
```

The following core workload types are available and enforced by OAM specification:

|Name|Category|Schema|Exposed|Replicable|Daemonized|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|[Server](core/workloads/server.md)|Core|[ContainerizedWorkload](core/workloads/schema/containerized_workload.md)|Yes|Yes|Yes

### Standard Workload Type

A standard workload type MUST be in the `standard.oam.dev` group. OAM implementations are NOT REQUIRED to implement standard workload types. However, if an implementation implements a workload that is already defined by a standard workload, it SHOULD use the standard workload definition as defined in this specification. Here is an example of a standard workload type.

```yaml
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: WebService
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: demotype.standard.oam.dev # this is a standard workload type
```

### Extended Workload Type

Each OAM runtime may define its own workload types beyond this specification. Any workload type that is not part of the _core_ or _standard_ group is considered an extended workload type. The name and schema of extended workload types are entirely at the discretion of the OAM implementation.

 Here is an example of an extended workload:

```yaml
kind: WorkloadDefinition
metadata:
  name: Redis
spec:
  definitionRef:
    name: redis.cache.aliyun.com # this is an extended workload type
```

## Characteristics of Workload Types

Component owners could add below reserved `metadata.labels` to workload definition to indicates _the distinguishing characteristics_ of the workload type. 

|Label|Type|Explain|
|-|-|-|
|`workload.oam.dev/replicable`|boolean|Whether they are replicable. If not, no replication or scaling traits may be assigned.|
|`workload.oam.dev/daemonized`|boolean|Whether they are daemonized. For daemon types, if the workload exits, this is considered a fault, and the system must fix it. For non-daemonized types, exit is considered a success if no error is reported.|
|`workload.oam.dev/exposed`|boolean|Whether they are exposed, i.e. have a service endpoint with a stable name for network traffic. Workload types that have a service endpoint need a virtual IP address (VIP) with a DNS name to represent the component as a whole, addressable within their network scope and can be assigned traffic routing traits.|
|`workload.oam.dev/podspecable`|boolean|Whether this workload can be addressed by Kubernetes `PodSpec`. If yes, the implementation could manipulate the workload by leveraging `PodSpec` structure, instead of being agnostic of the workload's schematic. |

These characteristics will be honored by _applies to_ feature of Traits.
