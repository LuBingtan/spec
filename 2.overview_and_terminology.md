# 2. Overview and Terminology

This section provides an overview of the Open Application Model (OAM) and its terminology. It begins by identifying the organization roles that are involved in the process of running cloud native applications. From there, it lays out the specific terminology that is used throughout this document.

## Roles and Responsibilities

As a foundation for the specification, several roles and corresponding responsibilities are defined in OAM specification, please check [personas introduction for more detail](./introduction.md). 

## Overview of the Model

This specification proposes a model that defines cloud native applications as follows:

> A cloud native application is a collection of interrelated, but discrete components (services, tasks, workers) that, when coupled with configuration and instantiated in a suitable runtime, together accomplish a unified functional purpose.

The application model defines the following:

- Component, together with the workload type it can execute and schematic for its settings.
- Traits are overlays that augment a component with additional operations-specific features. Traits represent operator concerns.
- Application scopes represent application boundaries by grouping components with common properties or dependencies.
- An application configuration describes a set of component instances, their traits, and the application scopes in which they are placed, combined with configuration parameters and metadata.

Thus, an **application** is a collection of components with a set of operational traits and scoped together into one or more application boundaries.

## Representing OAM Objects as Schematics

The OAM specification represents OAM objects (workload definitions, components, trait definitions, application configurations, etc.) as _schematics_. A schematic is a structured document that provides a declaration of an object or an object's desired state. Throughout this specification, schematics are represented in [YAML](https://yaml.org/). However, nothing in this specification precludes the possibility of representing schematics as JSON documents or other similarly structured textual or binary representations.

### The Structure of a Schematic

Schematics all follow a similar pattern. Top-level attributes indicate the type of schematic, including its group, version, and kind (see above). A `metadata` section provides information about a particular schematic. All schematics defined in this specification use the same `metadata` attributes, as defined below. Finally, a `spec` section provides the _specification_ for the schematic. For example, the `spec` section of a [Trait](6.traits.md) describes the trait itself, while the `spec` section of an [Application](7.application_configuration.md) describes the components and traits that together comprise an application deployment.

The following example of a application exhibits all three of these sections:

```yaml
apiVersion: core.oam.dev/v1alpha2   ## Group and version
kind: Application                   ## Kind
metadata:                           ## Metadata
  name: my-app
spec:                               ## Specification
  components:
    - name: my-web-app-component
      type: webservice
      settings:
        image: "nginx"
      traits:
        - name: scaler
          properties:
            replicas: 2
```

> The representational format used by OAM is derived from Kubernetes. However, OAM's design does not require Kubernetes.

The metadata section is common across all defined schematics. Kubernetes implementors are free to import [Kubernetes metadata library](https://github.com/kubernetes/apimachinery/blob/master/pkg/apis/meta/v1/types.go). For other runtimes, feel free to implement this section based on [metadata spec documentation](./metadata.md).
